# WeatherApp

## Setup
Run `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Future Scope
We can add search feature, so it will fetch data as provided city.
We can create multiple modules so the user can analyze data daily, weekly, monthly.
We can do weather Map integration.
